First we need to create a DigitalOcean account and create a new droplet. You can
find the instructions for this in the [DigitalOcean documentation](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/droplets/how-to/create/).

## Connect via ssh to the droplet to set up the environment

After creating the droplet, we need to connect to it using SSH. The following
steps will guide you through the process:

1. Open your terminal
1. Run the following command to connect to your droplet:

```bash
ssh root@<your_droplet_ip>
```

Here you can create a new user and set up a password for it. This is a more
secure way to connect to your droplet. The root user has full access to the system, 
it is recommended to create a new user with limited permissions. 

Run the following command to create a new user:
```bash
adduser <username>
usermod -aG sudo <username>
```

Then you would login with the new user this way:
```bash
ssh <username>@<your_droplet_ip>
```

3. Enter your password when prompted. You are now connected to your droplet

Run the following command to update the package list:

```bash
apt-get update
```

Now we will install the Git and Go programming language on the droplet.

```bash
apt install git golang
```

## Setup Git

```bash
git config --global user.name "<Name>"
git config --global user.email "<GH-Mail>"
```

## Build the Go Web Application

First we create the directory for our Go web application:
```bash
mkdir ~/go-web-app
cd ~/go-web-app
```

Then we create the main file for our Go web application:
```bash
# you can use nano too
vim main.go
```

To create a simple web server, add the following code to the `main.go` file:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello World")
	})

	http.HandleFunc("/greet/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		name := r.URL.Path[len("/greet/"):]
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello %s\n", name)
	})

	http.ListenAndServe(":9990", nil)
}
```

Then build the binary:
```bash
go build main.go
```

This will create a binary file named `main` in the go app directory.

## Create the Systemd Service

Now we have the binary file for our Go web application, but running it manually
is not enough to ensure the application stays active after server restarts
or crashes. To address this, we need to create a systemd service file. 

This file will define how our application should be managed by the system, 
ensuring it starts automatically on boot and restarts if it crashes.

```bash
# you can name it as you like
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/go-web-app.service
```

The content of the `go-web-app.service` file should look like this:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=<name-of-your-app>

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5s
ExecStart=/home/<username>/<path-to-go-app>/main

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

To start the service and enable it to start on boot, run the following commands:
```bash
sudo systemctl start go-web-app
sudo systemctl enable go-web-app
```

## Setup Nginx and reverse proxy

First of all, we need to install Nginx on the droplet. Run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

Now we need to configure Nginx to serve our Go web application. Create a new
file in the `/etc/nginx/sites-available` directory:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/<your_domain>
```

Now add the following configuration to the file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/<your_domain>`:

```nginx
server {
    server_name your_domain www.your_domain;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    }
}
```

The `proxy_pass` directive tells Nginx to forward all requests to the specified URL.

Next we need to create a symbolic link to the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` directory:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/<your_domain> /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

And reload the Nginx service:
```bash
sudo nginx -s reload
```

To make sure that the deployment is successful, you can visit your domain in a 
web browser go to **http://your_domain** and you should see the message `Hello World`.

It might be that your domain service is not pointing to the correct DNS server. 
For changing that you need to go to your domain provider and point the domain to the correct DNS server.

For example for porkbun you can do the following:
1. Go to your domain provider and login
2. Go to the DNS settings
3. Add a new A record with the IP of your droplet with no host
4. Add a new A record with the IP of your droplet with www as the host
5. Save the changes

This is better explained in this link [Setup Porkbun DNS with external VPS](https://kb.porkbun.com/article/54-pointing-your-domain-to-hosting-with-a-records).

## Bonus: Firewall Setup

## Secure the Nginx with Let's Encrypt

This is an optional step, but it's recommended to secure your Nginx server with a
free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt, so the domain can be accesed via HTTPS.

TODO: Setup firewall

# Generate a deploy SSH key

This step is necesary to allow the server to pull the code from the repository. 

First we need to generate a new SSH key on the server:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deploy@your_domain"
```

This command generates a new SSH key using the Ed25519 algorithm, which is more
secure and efficient than older algorithms. The `-C` flag adds a comment to
identify the key.

> **Important:** If you already have a key generated, you can skip this step.
> Only proceed with creating a new key if you don't have one or want a separate
> key for deployment.

To know if you already have a key generated you can run the command above and
you will see something like this:
```bash
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_ed25519):
/root/.ssh/id_ed25519 already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)?
```

Then we should say `n` and we can use the existing key or generate a separated
one with the following command:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deploy@your_domain" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_deploy
```

This will create a separated key that you can use specifically for the
deployment of your domain.

After generating the key, you'll need to add it to your GitHub or GitLab account:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy the output and add it as a deploy key in your repository settings on GitHub
or GitLab. More info on how to add a deploy key can be found in the 
[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys#set-up-deploy-keys).

Next, test the SSH connection to ensure it's working correctly:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

With this setup, we can now clone the repository onto the server and implement
an automated deployment process. We can achieve this with GitHub Actions:

In the next section, we'll explore how to set this up.
