## A world of illusion

A couple of months ago I started my journey to get out of social media, at least
as much as possible. I removed the *last standing* social apps that I had:
Instagram, to "keep up" with my friends, and TikTok, to "keep up" with the news
and kept some like YouTube, Reddit, etc.

This seemed hard at the start, and I had recurring thoughts multiple times about
how unconnected from my social circle and "THE NEWS" I was becoming. But surprisingly,
it got easier quickly, and I think this is not because I am not interested in
my friends or the accounts that I followed on TikTok, but because of how
unpleasant I felt when using these apps.

For me it is not only how the UI nowadays is at least 10 times more addictive
than before, or how many more ads we now have everywhere. The main problem, and
the reason that was making it unpleasant, is how little control I had over what 
I was seeing while using the app.

The apps got completely algorithm centric, and everything is made to take you away
from the plan that you had when opening the app, to get you back into the algorithm.
You already know what I am talking about.

## Instagram

Instagram was an easy one. I uninstalled the app and did not have any cravings again.
I am already in contact with my close friends and family via messaging apps, and when I used it 
the majority of the time I was simply doomscrolling accounts of other people that I
do not care about as much. The only problem was when friends sent me some links, or
I wanted to check the profile of some artist to look for tour dates or any other interesting topics.
In those cases I used the browser version, and that sometimes got me back into Insta stories or doomscrolling.

The solution that I found for that was to add a blocking rule in uBlock Origin
for the web version, so every time I open a link from `instagram.com` I get a
screen with the message "uBlock Origin has prevented the following page from loading"
and a "Go back" and "Proceed" button. This way at least I get a big warning to
remind me of the dangers of Instagram before diving in.

## TikTok and some alternatives

**TikTok** was harder to get out of. My brain got too addicted to having small dopamine
spikes during the day while feeling up to date with current geopolitical
affairs and the tech news.

"How am I supposed to live my life without knowing what crazy thing Donald Trump
said 2 hours ago?!"

So in the end, of course, the solution was simply not using the app.
I uninstalled it and stuck with the demons I already knew: YouTube, Reddit and HN.

The problem is that **YouTube** is falling into the same basket of addictive algorithmic
apps. I want to keep it because I can still find high quality content there,
but also a lot of content there now a days that is made to release quick dopamine hits.

This was dangerous because I would use it in the same way that I was using TikTok.

**Reddit** sometimes can have the same effect when doomscrolling comments, and some
of the tech communities that I follow can get too dramatic/toxic sometimes, so
I just use it to do some research about specific topics.

The way I use [**Hacker News**](https://news.ycombinator.com/) its not that bad
given that I just check the "Top Stories" page in search for some tech and
software releated news and normally I don't get too interested in the comment
section if its not something that I am specifically interested into. 

So I decided to keep those three apps as "alternatives" to the addictive TikTok,
but with some rueles.

- **YouTube**: Love some content there but its getting more dangerous every day to 
use their UI. I added a 1h a day time limit and deleted it from my home screen.
- **Reddit**: Doomscrollable UI but in my case I just deleted it from my phone home 
page and found that I do not use it as much anymore, just when doing web research 
about topics. No needed for limitation rules.
- **Hacker News**: This is still in my phone home screen, can easly check it for 30m 
a day and forget about it. The UI is really simple and not addictive at all.

But still I felt that I did not have as much control on the content that I 
consume as I would like to, for sure there should be a better way.

## The solution

I used RSS in the past but it never stuck with me. I also did not love many of
the big reader apps that people recommended online, like [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/).

This time I got interested in RSS again because I was searching for a way to
subscribe to multiple sources in one feed and thought that I needed to create my
own app because I did not find something similar.

But, of course, I was reinventing the wheel, given that this already existed, it’s RSS! 
As my mother-in-law would say, I had a Milky Way moment[^1].

The only feature that I was missing was a way to sync all my RSS sources across
different RSS reader apps, like for example [FeedFlow](https://www.feedflow.dev/)
or [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/).

Of course this also already existed, and it’s one of the main reasons I got back
into RSS. It is called [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/). 

Basically its a selfhosted server where you can create multiple accounts to
store RSS feeds, and those feed sources can be consumed by multiple RSS reader
apps via an integration.

You can also be perfectly happy simply using the default Miniflux UI, as it is
simple and performant.

Miniflux is designed to use as few resources as possible. You can run an
instance on a Pi Zero or a NAS with no down time at all. 

For now, I decided to use a PikaPod instance for the small price of $10/year + 
$5 for daily backups. In the near future I might get a NAS and run it there,
with some other selfhosted solutions like [Immich](https://immich.app/), but
this is for another day and it that case it will get free fast.

## The difference

The sensible thing to do now is to ask: what do I gain from running this Miniflux 
instance or with any form of RSS in general? Yeah its techy and cool but why?

And the response to that its simple: Control.

Now when I see some blog post, podcast or YouTube channel that I like, I simply add 
it to my Miniflux instance, so every time any of those sources adds new content 
I will be update by in a minimal feed, of my choice, that only shows what I
want it to show. And of course I would like to get once in a while lost in the 
YouTube algorithm to find new interesting topics, but it will be willingly and 
not when I just want to check an update of my favorite channel.

And given that it is all on a Miniflux server I can have multiple devices, with 
the apps that I like the most for each device, without having to export import and 
share my data with any Venture Capital company like Feedly or Google with Google 
Reader.

You own your feed, you own what you consume and more importantly you control
the way that you consume it. I hope it has been a useful quick read.

[^1]: A Milcky Way moment is a term used by my girlfriend and my monther in law 
to describe when you have a revelation about the meaning or the ethimology of some word 
or phrase that you used for a while. Once you have the milcky way moment, it now makes 
sense and you can't unsee it. A good example would be Rayban, its not the last name
of the brand founder but just the wording use to describe glasses that *ban rays*.
